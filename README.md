# Figma MCP Integration with Atomic Design

A Next.js application demonstrating how to integrate **Figma Model Context Protocol (MCP)** into a codebase using **Atomic Design principles**. This project showcases a seamless workflow from Figma designs to production-ready React components.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project bridges the gap between design and development by leveraging Figma MCP to extract design specifications directly from Figma files and transform them into a structured, maintainable component library following atomic design methodology.

**Figma File**: [Positivus Landing Page Design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1230604708032389430/positivus-landing-page-design)

## 🧩 What is Atomic Design?

Atomic Design is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking down interfaces into fundamental building blocks:

1. **Atoms** - Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, labels)
2. **Molecules** - Simple combinations of atoms (form fields, search bars)
3. **Organisms** - Complex components (headers, forms, navigation)
4. **Templates** - Page-level layouts
5. **Pages** - Specific instances of templates
